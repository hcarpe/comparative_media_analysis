Hand declares that mid-20th century radio horror “remains one of the richest eras in popular horror culture” (Sitting 49). I will be looking at <i>Limetown</i> through the lens of self-reflexivity and metalepsis.</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper"><i>Limetown</i> is a podcast released in 2015 by Two-Up Productions. In the first season, American Public Radio reporter Lia Haddock explores exactly what happened during The Panic on the night of February 8, 2004, in Limetown, Tennessee when 327 men, women, and children disappeared and haven’t been heard from since. After publishing the first episode, Lia is contacted by a string of Limetown survivors, each interview ending with more questions than answers. Limetown is revealed to be a front for a secret scientific experiment determining whether humans can possibly partake in mind-to-mind contact via a chip implanted in someone’s brain. Season one ends with Lia meeting Lenore Dougal, the double-agent hired to convince the orchestrator of Limetown to sell the project to another company, who reveals exactly what happened during The Panic and after. The second season, released in 2018, begins five days after Lia has been abducted mid-interview with Lenore Dougal. The podcast was successful, becoming the number one podcast in the US in under 2 months, and <i>Limetown</i> was eventually adapted to become a TV show on the Peacock streaming service in 2019. For this project, I will be focusing only on the podcast’s first season.</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper">Crawford notes that in "traditional ‘found document’ or ‘found footage’ horror fiction, the action is over by the time the audience arrives, the author or filmmaker is dead (or worse), and all that remains is to go through the films or papers they have left behind in order to discover what happened to them” (Crawford 75). <i>Limetown</i> does have found footage embedded into the narrative, but the footage isn’t "found" in a traditional sense. Instead of stumbling across footage such as audiotapes of the 911 call from Limetown requesting emergency services and other tapes of The Panic, Lia finds the footage through research and as gifts through the connections she makes with Limetown survivors.</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper"><i>Limetown</i> is self-reflexive in its presentation of found footage because of the unorthodox ways in which Lia comes into possession of the Limetown footage. In more traditional forms of ‘found footage’ media, characters are not intentionally searching for the footage that is found, the most popular example being <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> in which the students’ footage is unexpectedly “found” by police searching for the missing students. In a stunning twist of events in the last episode of the first season, Lia’s own podcast becomes found footage when the podcast is dramatically cut off from its live broadcast and Lia is found missing from the scene of the taping.</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper">In their “Sound, horror and radio” article, Hand describes how off-stage sounds in plays in the early 20th century served to “paint a picture of the world beyond the confines of the … tiny, claustrophobic stage as well as enhanc[e] the mood of the story,” (Sitting 12). Hand goes on to describe that while stage actors were more melodramatic, voice actors in radio dramas of the time created “a more natural, intimate style” and experience for the audience (Sitting 33). Even today, podcasts and radio shows appear more intimate than plays by sounding more natural and conversational.</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper">In another one of their articles (coincidentally from the same book appropriately titled <i>Listen in Terror</i>) “Multifarious terrors: horror audio in the digital age,” Richard J. Hand notes that “not only has high-quality location recording become easier to realise for the producer, but the concept of location has also become a more important consideration for the listener” (horror audio 191). <i>Limetown</i> knows how important location has become for an audience, so when Lia is outside we hear birds chirping and when she is by the ocean we hear the waves. We even hear the first Limetown survivor to come forward, Winona, making tea in the background of her interview. This metalepsis serves the purpose of transgressing boundaries inside and outside of the text, the text being the podcast, in order to humanize the fictional by relating it to our own soundscapes.</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper">In addition to audio horror, Radio shows have evolved to allow audience choice. Crawford notes that, in radio, “the listener will get an enhanced experience if he or she is actively involved in the creative process, whether that is by directly influencing the storyline or by contributing a large dose of imagination to the production”. By the twenty-first century, audiences have been required to not only listen but “physically engage, to take control and even some responsibility in shaping the unfurling narrative,” by voting for contestants on shows such as <i>American Idol</i> and <i>Big Brother</i> (Crawford 197).</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper">One engaging feature of Gothic digital technologies that Crawford discusses is the “horrible hyperlink,” which “effectively dares the reader to click on it despite their knowledge that it might lead to something awful” (Crawford 76). The hyperlink function brings to mind Twine, an open-source software that allows users to create custom, choose your own adventure story-driven games on their computer. One such story is <i>My Father’s Long, Long Legs</i>, an “interactive horror story about family, unease, and loss” (ztul). In the game, the protagonist describes growing up in a midwestern house with a dirt basement. Their father slowly retreats deeper and deeper into the basement as he digs tunnels downward in order to return to humanity’s “original glory”. Their mother eventually leaves their father and takes the protagonist and their brother with her; the protagonist returns years later alongside their brother to check on their father, and the protagonist loses their brother in the basement after being scared of what their father has become and fleeing. When the protagonist is in the basement searching for their father and brother, the player’s mouse becomes a flashlight and only a small radius of the page is visible at a time.</div>

After the protagonist flees, a picture of their father’s long, long legs flash on the screen, designed to surprise the player. At one point, the screen goes blank except for the flashlight's light and audio of their father humming a tune is played as well, evoking Mark Fisher’s notion of the eerie we discussed in class.</div>

        <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper">Crawford notes that the digital Gothic “takes advantage of the way in which webpages tend to be read.” Since most users scroll reflexively as they read, by the time they reach anything scary it has already appeared on-screen and is unavoidable to the eye. This is different from a book, where readers can choose whether they want to deliberately turn a page to see the horror they know (or think they know) is coming. “Online, such material can ‘creep up on’ the reader, appearing onscreen almost before they realize it is there” (Crawford 79). This is certainly true in <i>My Father’s Long, Long Legs</i>, as the image automatically appears on the screen without the user having to do anything at all.</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper">Hand connects the idea of listeners gaining “greater freedom to access, acquire or download material” and online digital Gothic interactivity to gaming, noting that “the decisions and actions of the player can have a direct impact on the game and its narrative, creating a sense of choice, even if such choices may be illusory to different degrees” (horror audio 192, 193). Twine connects both interactivity and choice. The Twine interface also helps authors utilize hypermediation by employing a distinct interface for users to play on that is unlike any other game.</div>

More traditional Gothic elements include a big reveal of past secrets resurfacing, and while the truth of what really happened in Limetown is the past secret that is revealed at the end of the podcast’s first season, <i>My Father’s Long, Long Legs</i> does not appear to have a reveal of the same caliber. The father’s legs are revealed, but no hint as to why the protagonist’s father is digging in their basement is ever given except for the protagonist’s uncle telling the father that he has "done very well for himself, all things considered" (ztul).</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper">A lot has changed in the world of online horror since the internet was first invented, and as “old barriers between traditional horror media (copyrighted, single-author, for-profit, overtly fictional) and online horror media (viral, anonymous, crowdsourced, non-commercial, often blurring the lines between fact and fiction) have increasingly broken down … some creators of online horror fiction have become more professional, while others have retreated deeper into anonymity” (Crawford 82, 83). The creators of <i>Limetown</i> have taken a more professional approach by releasing a professionally produced podcast onto major streaming platforms such as <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1tshi3C3cIBEj6XkyLuo6b?si=c435fbfc2aea428b" target="blank">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/limetown/id1024247322" target="blank">Apple Podcasts</a>. <a href="https://twinery.org/" target="blank">Twine</a> is a much lesser-known tool, and as a result, <i>My Father’s Long, Long Legs</i>, on the other hand, has taken a more anonymous approach. The game is posted on <a href="https://itch.io/" target="blank">itch.io</a>, “an open marketplace for independent digital creators with a focus on independent video games.” Itch.io has become “a collection of some of the most unique, interesting, and independent creations you'll find on the web,” but the website is in no way, shape, or form mainstream (itch.io).</div>

Both <i>Limetown</i> and <i>My Father’s Long, Long Legs</i> use sound effects to elicit a response in their audience. <i>Limetown</i> does use sound more often to elicit a response from the audience, but it is important to note that <i>Limetown</i> is dependent upon sounds more than <i>My father’s Long, Long Legs</i> because a podcast is only audio and thus cannot rely on any visual components.</div>

At one point or another, both <i>Limetown</i> and <i>My Father’s Long, Long Legs</i> are “structured by the language of sound, making us hear and thus feel the environment,” and this notion of sound lying dormant until needed elicits Fisher’s notion of the eerie as well as Hand’s notion of location recording (sitting 15). Both the presence and absence of sound can be used to elicit horror in an audience; while sound can be used to indicate location and the eerie, it can also be taken away in order to put an audience on edge as well.</div>
