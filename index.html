Hand declares that mid-20th century radio horror “remains one of the richest eras in popular horror culture” (Sitting 49). I will be looking at <i>Limetown</i> through the lens of self-reflexivity and metalepsis.</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper"><i>Limetown</i> is a podcast released in 2015 by Two-Up Productions. In the first season, American Public Radio reporter Lia Haddock explores exactly what happened on the night of February 8, 2004, in Limetown, Tennessee when 327 men, women, and children disappeared and haven’t been heard from since. After publishing the first episode, Lia is contacted by a string of Limetown survivors, each interview ending with more questions than answers. Limetown is revealed to be a front for a secret scientific experiment determining whether humans can possibly partake in mind-to-mind contact via a chip implanted in someone’s brain. Season one ends with Lia meeting Lenore Dougal, the double-agent hired to convince the orchestrator of Limetown to sell the project to another company, who reveals exactly what happened on February 8, 2004, and after. The second season, released in 2018, begins five days after Lia has been abducted mid-interview with Lenore Dougal. The podcast was successful, becoming the number one podcast in the US in under 2 months, and <i>Limetown</i> was eventually adapted to become a TV show on the Peacock streaming service in 2019. For this project, I will be focusing only on the podcast’s first season.</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper">Crawford notes that “in traditional ‘found document’ or ‘found footage’ horror fiction, the action is over by the time the audience arrives, the author or filmmaker is dead (or worse), and all that remains is to go through the films or papers they have left behind in order to discover what happened to them” (Crawford 75). <i>Limetown</i> does have found footage embedded into the narrative, but the footage isn’t ‘found’ in a traditional sense. Instead of stumbling across footage such as audiotapes of the 911 call from Limetown requesting emergency services and other tapes of The Panic, Lea finds the footage through research and as gifts through the connections she makes with Limetown survivors.</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper"><i>Limetown</i> is self-reflexive in its presentation of found footage because of the unorthodox ways in which Lia comes into possession of the Limetown footage. In more traditional forms of ‘found footage’ media, characters are not intentionally searching for the footage that is found, the most popular example being <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> in which the students’ footage is “found” by police searching for the missing students. In a stunning twist of events in the last episode of the first season, Lia’s own podcast becomes found footage when the podcast is dramatically cut off from its live broadcast, and Lia is found missing from the scene of the taping.</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper">In their “Sound, horror and radio” article, Hand describes how off-stage sounds in plays in the early 20th century served to “paint a picture of the world beyond the confines of the … tiny, claustrophobic stage as well as enhanc[e] the mood of the story,” (Sitting 12). Hand goes on to describe that while stage actors were more melodramatic, voice actors in radio dramas of the time created “a more natural, intimate style” and experience for the audience (Sitting 33). Even today, podcasts and radio shows appear more intimate than plays by sounding more natural and conversational.</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper">One of the ways in which radio and podcasts make their recordings so natural is through outside sound effects. Whenever Lia is conducting an interview, the audience is made keenly aware of what is going on around the interview through sound effects.</div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left paper">In another one of their articles (coincidentally from the same book appropriately titled Listen in Terror) “Multifarious terrors: horror audio in the digital age,” Richard J. Hand notes that “not only has high-quality location recording become easier to realise for the producer, but the concept of location has also become a more important consideration for the listener” (horror audio 191). <i>Limetown</i> knows how important location has become for an audial audience, so whenever Lia is outside we hear birds chirping and whenever we are by the ocean we hear the waves. We even hear the first Limetown survivor to come forward, Winona, making tea in the background of her interview. This metalepsis serves the purpose of transgressing boundaries inside and outside of the text, the text being the podcast, in order to humanize the fictional by relating it to our own soundscapes.</div>
